## Generate corresponding y-values according to the model y ~ 25 + 4x + e, where e~N(0,var=12^2)
y <- 25 + 4*x + rnorm(100, mean=0, sd = 12)

## Question 2: ##
#################

# Generate the linear model requested in Question 1 1000 times. 
# Create a new vector of y-values for each repetition.

# initiate two vectors to keep track of b0hat and b1hat values for each linear model
b0vec<-vector()

  # for each iteration, create a new vector of y-values & generate a new linear model
  ytemp <- 25 + 4*x + rnorm(100, mean=0, sd = 12)
  dftemp <- data.frame(x,ytemp)
  lm.temp <- lm(ytemp~x, data=dftemp)
  # store coefficients of each linear model into corresponding location in vectors initiated outside of this for loop

#   (a) Determine and report the mean and variance of the generated coefficients.
mean(b0vec)
# 24.99197
mean(b1vec)
# 4.000139
var(b0vec)
# 21.53321
var(b1vec)
# 0.01246831

#   (b) Based on theoretical considerations, what should the mean and variance of the  
#       generated coefficients be? Explain your answer.

# b0hat and b1hat are least square estimators of the parameters of the true regression model.
# They are also unbiased estimators of the model parameters B0 and B1
# Thus, theoretically, the mean of the generated coefficients should be the true values of the coefficients
# of the population regression model, which means:
#     E{B1hat} = B1 & E{B0hat} = B0

# As for Var{B1hat} & Var{B0hat}, according to the Gauss-Markov Theorem, the least squares estimators have
# minimum variance when compared with all other unbiased estimators. Thus, the variances of B1hat and B0hat
# are minimum, hence they are the best linear unbiased estimators.


#   (c) Find a 95% confidence interval centered at each coefficient. Determine and report  
#       the percentage of intervals that contain the true value of the coefficient. 
#       What should the percentage be?
